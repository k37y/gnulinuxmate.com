<strong>How do you maintain this blog?</strong><br>This blog is a Jekyll generated static website hosted on GitHub Pages. I borrowed this template from <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Halve">Taylan Tatli</a> and made changes that I needed. My blog workflow is using <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlifycms</a> because of the easy content management and open-source license. For major and minor site changes, I do have Jekyll, Vim, Tmux, Apache and Firefox combination with Ubuntu or Arch Linux.<br>
