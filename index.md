# About Me

I am an avid fan of Linux and open source enthusiast. I have been enjoying Linux for the past one decade. Back in 2007, I stumbled upon an article about Ubuntu live CD. I didn't know it at the time but that moment changed my life. I know that statements like that belong on those exaggerators but it is actually true. Within 24 hours of reading the article I had turned my own desktop into Ubuntu one -- a platform where I have explored many Linux things ever since. If you just want to say hello, please do say hello at [hello@linuxmate.ml](mailto:hello@linuxmate.ml).
