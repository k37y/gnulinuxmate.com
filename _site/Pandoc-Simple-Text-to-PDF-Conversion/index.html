<p><strong>Although we do have rich-text editors, we do not really need those, which comes heavy, to write a simple letter and save it as PDF file. Moreover, some people like to work in terminal to make their work distraction-free (Yes, The complete Game of Thrones book was written with VIM text editor). Here, I am using VIM and PANDOC to do that job.</strong></p>

<p>Pandoc is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool which converts text to PDF, not only <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> files, but also <code class="highlighter-rouge">.html</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.md</code> and more. First of all, we are using VIM to write the content and <code class="highlighter-rouge">:wq!</code> to save it. Pandoc uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> to source the file and <code class="highlighter-rouge">-o</code> to output the file.<br />
For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pandoc -i file.txt -o file.pdf</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, pandoc can read Markdown format to enhance output.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Bold **text**</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Italics *text*</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Quote &gt;text</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Image [imageName](path)</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Link [text](link)</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Title %text</code></p>

<p>You must be wondering why do we need to learn all these to write a simple letter and why did I put the word simple in this blog title. But trust me, itâ€™d worth learning. Markdown format will be very useful in many websites. Last but not least, I have added <a href="/kevydotvinu.github.io/img/pandoc.pdf">here</a> the pdf copy of this post to get convinced.</p>
